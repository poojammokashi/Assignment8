How do you create nested routes react-router-dom configuration?
=>const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout/>,
    errorElement: <Error/>,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body/>,
      },
      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About/>,
        children: [
          {
            path: "profile",
            element: <Profile/>,
          },
        ],
      },
      }])
      
 What is the order of life cycle method calls in Class Based Components?
 =>Constructor
 Render
 ComponentDidMount
 ComponentDidUpdate
 ComponentWillUnMount
 
 
 Why do we use componetDidMount?
 componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes 
 should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.
 
 
 
 Why do we use componentWillUnMount? Show with example?
 componentWillUnmount() is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, 
 such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in componentDidMount().
